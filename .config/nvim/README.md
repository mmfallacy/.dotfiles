# Neovim Configuration for mmfallacy
This section of the dotfiles repository contains my neovim configuration

## Plugin Manager: `lazy.nvim`
I opted to use [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) instead of the now unmaintained packer.nvim as I would like to leverage the following features:
- Fast startup times
- Automatic Lazy Loading
- Manage plugins using a UI
- Automatic install if lazy is not yet installed.
